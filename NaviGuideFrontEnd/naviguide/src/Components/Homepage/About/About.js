                <p>The NaviGuide Project has been conceptualized to tackle the existing challenges in organizing and 
implementing awareness and consultant programs within various organizations across Sri Lanka. Recognizing 
the need for a more efficient and accessible platform, the NaviGuide Project aims to establish connections 
between resource persons, who are experts in diverse fields such as facilitation, education, subject matter 
expertise, speaking, consulting, or presenting, and educational institutions, organizations, or individuals 
seeking to engage with these resource persons. This platform is designed to facilitate effective communication, 
collaboration, and resource sharing between resource persons and the stakeholders, including educational 
institutions, organizations, communities, or individuals.
Currently, the absence of a centralized platform presents obstacles for resource persons (facilitators, educators, 
subject matter experts, speakers, or presenters) and communities (educational institutions, organizations, 
communities, or individuals). Resource persons often struggle to reach out to the community, while the 
community faces difficulties in identifying, contacting, and engaging suitable experts for their awareness 
programs and related activities. The NaviGuide Project aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly 
online environment where these stakeholders can seamlessly connect.</p>
